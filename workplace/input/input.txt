The manner in which the United States deals with China will be a critical, if not the critical, overseas challenge for the United States in the 21st century. What policy framework best optimizes our interests, which are multiple and not always consistent with each other?
China presents unique challenges for the United States in formulating a coherent, effective policy. It is woven into the fabric of the global economic and trading system and is a major and frequently constructive player in international organizations. But it also has large gaps in its adherence to global rules.
There are three broad options for the United States to respond to the China challenge: 1) accommodation; 2) containment, confrontation, or untrammeled strategic rivalry; and 3) global cooperation paired with regional resolve. The third option is best, in my view, because we need to find a middle course that would safeguard the array of conflicting interests we have. U.S.-China cooperation is possible on many global issues, which has already been demonstrated on climate change, cooperation in the P5+1 negotiations to roll back Iran’s nuclear weapons program, and foreign assistance, for example.
The United States will need to seek a balance between accepting a larger global role for a constructive China while building barriers and coalitions against coercion in China’s neighborhood. On global issues, a sensible approach should look for issues on which China, because of its own evolving interests, can and should play a greater role in supporting the global system. Examples include cybersecurity and cyber innovation, protecting the rights of foreign investors, central bank coordination, and protection of intellectual property rights. This middle policy may lack the bracing shock value of accommodation or untrammeled rivalry, but the burden is on their advocates to explain how a radical lurch in either direction would secure the complex range of U.S. interests in our relationship with China.
